His eyes drifted\\nto some eagles circling afew mules west. He also saw a few grey\\n\\u2018duds drifting in and wondered if rain would come. When he turned\\nback to look at the cubs, they were perched on a narrow ledge.\\nBelow them, the valley fell away, hundreds of fet. He could see no\\n\\u2018du ons nearby.\\n\\nBefore the cubs the small stone walkway\\ncontinued fora bt; then it ended in a\\nsheer rock face. Above them, the rocks\\nperched precariously.
